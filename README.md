# curriculum-databases-projects-template

This template should be used for your database-related projects. Generate your own repository, update this README, and edit all file contents while working on projects. You should not be adding any new files unless asked otherwise.

---

## 📖 Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

### Schema
Use `schema.sql` to create all tables.

```sql
-- Database schema to keep the structure of entire database.

CREATE TABLE animals (
    name varchar(100)
);
-- Populate database with sample data.

INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('Luna');
INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('Daisy');
INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('Charlie');
-- Queries that provide answers to the questions from all projects.

SELECT * FROM animals WHERE name = 'Luna';
Got it ✅ — here’s how your README would look polished up with proper GitHub Markdown formatting, code blocks, and structure. This is a **GitHub-ready raw README.md**:

## 📖 Getting Started

This repository includes files with plain SQL that can be used to recreate a database:

### Schema
Use `schema.sql` to create all tables.

```sql
-- Database schema to keep the structure of entire database.

CREATE TABLE animals (
    name varchar(100)
);
````

### Data

Use `data.sql` to populate tables with sample data.

```sql
-- Populate database with sample data.

INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('Luna');
INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('Daisy');
INSERT INTO animals (name) VALUES ('Charlie');
```

### Queries

Check `queries.sql` for examples of queries that can be run on a newly created database.
⚠️ **Important note:** this file might include queries that make changes in the database (e.g., remove records). Use them responsibly!

```sql
-- Queries that provide answers to the questions from all projects.

SELECT * FROM animals WHERE name = 'Luna';
```
